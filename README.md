# How-Much-You-ve-Spent-On-Shopee
Js code to check how much you've spent on shopee

This is very easy to use<br>
Firstly, you need go to: https://shopee.vn/user/purchase/<br>
Open console tab by press F12 or right click -> inspect.<br>

Use setInterval function to load to the bottom of the page, because Shopee use AJAX to load more produce so you need to wait some minute. <br>
Until you see the page not moving anymore, use clearInterval to stop scroll down code.<br>

Finally, paste all the remaining code in the file and press enter.<br>
Done!
