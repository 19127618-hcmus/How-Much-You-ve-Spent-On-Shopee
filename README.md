# How-Much-You-ve-Spent-On-Shopee
Js code to check how much you've spent on shopee

This is very easy to use
Firstly, you need go to: https://shopee.vn/user/purchase/
Open console tab by press F12 or right click -> inspect.

Use setInterval function to load to the bottom of the page, because Shopee use AJAX to load more produce so you need to wait some minute. 
Until you see the page not moving anymore, use clearInterval to stop scroll down code.

Finally, paste all the remaining code in the file and press enter.
Done!
